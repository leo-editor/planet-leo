<p>This week has been pretty productive for me.  LTD might just work!  Well, with some adjustments.  Particularly the gamification bit.  Points are useless, so I&#x2019;m probably going to ditch that bit as anything other than a weekly metric&#x2026;</p></div></summary><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Alright, off to a good start.</p>

<p>This week has been pretty productive for me.  LTD might just work!  Well, with some adjustments.  Particularly the gamification bit.  Points are useless, so I&#x2019;m probably going to ditch that bit as anything other than a weekly metric.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#x2019;s a quick rundown of what I was able to accomplish last week, once LTD kicked me into gear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work:

<ul>
<li>A whole bunch of minor cleanup for outstanding jobs</li>
<li>Closed two long-standing tickets in my inbox</li>
<li>Worked on an upcoming (this week) apache upgrade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Responsiblity:

<ul>
<li>Got my oil changed (2 weeks late :()</li>
<li>Finished off a defensive driving course</li>
<li>Got LTD up and running (sans scripting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leisure:

<ul>
<li>Read (a lot&#x2026; seriously, that never happens)</li>
<li>Updated some software on orison, my raspi</li>
<li>Worked on Mint Fudge</li>
<li>Worked on roguelike code</li>
<li>Started playing X: Beyond the Frontier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#x2019;s a lot more than I usually accomplish in a week, so it&#x2019;s nice seeing these reports and these early results.</p>

<p>Not that this particular post is interesting to anyone at all, but I promised myself I&#x2019;d be writing these, so here I am.</p>

<p>Thanks for dealing with me :P</p></div></content><updated planet:format="September 30, 2013 12:00 AM">2013-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated><published planet:format="September 30, 2013 12:00 AM">2013-09-30T00:00:00Z</published><author><name>Jake Peck</name></author><source><id>http://blog.suspended-chord.info</id><author><name>Jake Peck</name></author><link href="http://blog.suspended-chord.info/leo.xml" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><title>a-&gt;ab</title><updated planet:format="January 06, 2014 12:00 AM">2014-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated><planet:faceheight>85</planet:faceheight><planet:activity_threshold>0</planet:activity_threshold><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:facewidth>65</planet:facewidth><planet:http_etag>"401a6cd50bfb38a6747f6c6d3379d68f60e319d3"</planet:http_etag><planet:bozo>false</planet:bozo><planet:name>a&#x2192;ab (Jacob Peck)</planet:name><planet:css-id>a-ab-jacob-peck</planet:css-id><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
