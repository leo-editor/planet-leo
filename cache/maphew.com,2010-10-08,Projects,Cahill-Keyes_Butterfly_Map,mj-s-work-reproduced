<p>I've successfully recreated the single octant and eight octant Open
Office drawings from the macros and instructions provided. It took a
couple of hours because I had to figure out how OO macro dialogs work,
and don't. There were some errors at the beginning that went away by
themselves -- which always make me nervous because one is never sure if
one day they might also decide to come back by themselves! I used OO
v3.2 on linux so that may have contributed to the difficulty.</p>

 Anyway, the upshot is now I have a practical understanding of what the
macros do and some glimmerings of how to improve one or two things. I
don't have much faith in being able to use oo-Draw long term for this
project as it is quite sluggish already with just the grid and graticule
let alone any geography loaded. On the other hand, it *is* a working
prototype so it's not time to discard just yet. :)\
 \
 The .svg file was created by a simple <em>File &gt; Export</em> from oo-Draw and
loads into Inkscape very nicely. This is encouraging as it means the
work is portable; SVG - scalable vector graphic - is a vendor 
independent standard format understood by a variety of programs in both
the graphic design and GIS/CAD industries.\
