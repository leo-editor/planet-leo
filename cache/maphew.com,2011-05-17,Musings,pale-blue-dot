came across my desk and inspired me to make a poster. Well, it inspired
me to find a poster, but I didn't locate one that resonated just the
right way with me, so I made my own.</p>
<p><em>A portion of the first ever 'portrait' of the solar system taken by
Voyager 1 in 1990 from a distance of more than 4 billion miles from
Earth. Our world is a mere point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixels
in size, coincidentally right in the center of a scattered light ray,
resulting from taking the image so close to the sun.</em></p><em>
<p>&quot;We succeeded in taking that picture , and, if you look at it, you see
a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever
heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The
aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident
religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager,
every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations,
every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child,
every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of
morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader,
every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a
mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
<p>The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in
glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable
inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are
challenged by this point of pale light.</p>
<p>Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In
our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will
come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been
said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building
experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the
folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To
me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and
compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale
blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</p>
