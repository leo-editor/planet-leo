<p>Last week while on a canoe trip we spotted a minivan crashed in the
river, at the bottom of a 30m+ cliff. From the open driver's side door
It looked like it had been pushed over the edge, and, judging from the
multi-level water stains on the side, had been there for a week or two
at least. Still, being good citizens when we got to somewhere we could
make a call we phoned the police just in case nobody had reported it
yet. They received the report easily enough but then demanded name,
phone number, street address, a few other things I don't recall, and
birthdate. Needing to know name and number makes sense, address is a bit
more intrusive, but okay, who knows, maybe I'm a disgruntled lover
trying to get someone in trouble. But birthdate? Take a hike! That's
irrelevant to the issue at hand and none of their business.</p>
<p>This morning while walking the dog along a bush trail I found a bike
that looked stolen or abandoned. Late this evening it was still there.
Now I know from past experience that a bike left on it's own in the
trees will very likely soon end up a kilometer or two down the trail
smashed and bent, and with some of the better bits missing altogether.
An unknown faceless someone would likely be very grateful to have it
moved somewhere for safekeeping and reported to the authorities, meaning
the police, and eventually returned safely home to them. And I'd feel
pretty good for having played the good samaritan. Trouble is I don't
want the police treating me like a suspect when all I'm trying to do is
hand someone else a good turn.</p>
<p>I'll call them, eventually, an unknown faceless someone deserves it, but
I have to overcome resistance to do so. Maybe next time I see something
by the trail or in the water I'll just keep going. Come to think of it,
maybe that's why I have the past experience in the first place of seeing
unattended things transformed into junk and garbage. Others before me
had decided it's just not worth the hassle; &quot;nothing to see here, move
along.&quot;    That's sad.</p></div></content><updated planet:format="July 06, 2011 08:00 AM">2011-07-06T08:00:00Z</updated><category term="musings"/><author><name>matt wilkie</name><email>maphew+website@gmail.com</email><uri>http://www.maphew.com/</uri></author><source><id>tag:www.maphew.com,2011-06-11:/atom/</id><icon>http://www.maphew.com/favicon.ico</icon><logo>http://www.maphew.com/feed-logo.png</logo><author><name>matt wilkie</name><email>maphew+website@gmail.com</email><uri>http://www.maphew.com/</uri></author><link href="http://www.maphew.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.maphew.com/atom/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><title xml:lang="En">a hewer of maps</title><updated planet:format="May 17, 2013 08:54 AM">2013-05-17T08:54:00Z</updated><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>&quot;2699bcc-1a063-4ec5e8c135200&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sat, 30 Nov 2013 05:52:08 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>true</planet:bozo><planet:activity_threshold>0</planet:activity_threshold><planet:facewidth>65</planet:facewidth><planet:faceheight>85</planet:faceheight><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
