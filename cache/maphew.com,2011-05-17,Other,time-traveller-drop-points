 Subject: Dimensional warp Generator Needed ubamz\
 Date: 09 Aug 2003 16:33:10 +0000</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m a time traveler stuck here in 2003. Upon arriving here my
dimensional warp generator stopped working. I trusted a company here by
the name of LLC Lasers to repair my Generation 3 52 4350A watch unit,
and they fled on me. I am going to need a new DWG unit, prefereably the
rechargeable AMD wrist watch model with the GRC79 induction motor, four
I80200 warp stabilizers, 512GB of SRAM and the menu driven GUI with
front panel XID display.</p>
<p>I will take whatever model you have in stock, as long as its received
certification for being safe on carbon based life forms.</p>
<p>In terms of payment:</p>
<p>Payment can be made in Galactic Credits, Platinum gold, or 2003 currency
upon safe delivery of unit.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY:</p>
<p>Please transport unit in either a brown paper bag or box to below
coordinates on Saturday August 9th at (exactly 3:00pm) Eastern Standard
Time on the dot. A few minutes prior will be ok, but it cannot be after.
If you miss this timeframe please email me. I will not be there prior to
2:45pm EST, (so do not transport before then).</p>
<p>\

in a larger map</p>
<p>Item is to be delivered at Majority Lane in Woburn, Massachusetts
located at: Latitude N 42.49430 &amp; Longitude W 071.14275 and the
Elevation is 140 feet.</p>
<p>WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT ITEM BY REGULAR MEANS OF
TELEPORTATION. THEY ARE MONITORING AND WILL REDIRECT THE SIGNAL!!</p>
<p>I DO NOT CARE HOW YOU HAVE TO GET IT HERE, JUST DO IT IN A WAY THAT NO
SPYING EYES WILL POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO REDIRECT or BLOCK THE TRANSFERENCE.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE TRANSFER.</p>
<p>HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SEND IT SO THAT THEY CANNOT REDIRECT OR BLOCK IT???
If in doubt do not transport actual unit until your method of transfer
can be confirmed as a success. You just might need to send a
intergalactic courier to deliver item safely to me. If so be VERY
careful at how they approach me.</p>
<p>It is best if you send a intergalactic courier to deliver, this way you
can be certain the unit arrives ok, However If you are certain that you
have the means to teleport unit in a safe manner please send a
(separate) email to me at:
<a href="http://www.maphew.com\Other\time-traveller-drop-points\mailto:webmaster@federalfundingprogram.com" title="mailto:webmaster@federalfundingprogram.com">webmaster@federalfundingprogram.com</a>
only after unit has been safely delivered with payment instructions.</p>
<p>Do not reply directly back to this email as it will only be bounced back
to you.</p></div></content><updated planet:format="May 17, 2011 08:00 AM">2011-05-17T08:00:00Z</updated><category term="other"/><category term="projects"/><author><name>matt wilkie</name><email>maphew+website@gmail.com</email><uri>http://www.maphew.com/</uri></author><source><id>tag:www.maphew.com,2011-06-11:/atom/</id><icon>http://www.maphew.com/favicon.ico</icon><logo>http://www.maphew.com/feed-logo.png</logo><author><name>matt wilkie</name><email>maphew+website@gmail.com</email><uri>http://www.maphew.com/</uri></author><link href="http://www.maphew.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.maphew.com/atom/" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><title xml:lang="En">a hewer of maps</title><updated planet:format="May 17, 2013 08:54 AM">2013-05-17T08:54:00Z</updated><planet:format>atom10</planet:format><planet:http_etag>&quot;2699bcc-1a063-4ec5e8c135200&quot;</planet:http_etag><planet:http_last_modified>Sat, 30 Nov 2013 05:52:08 GMT</planet:http_last_modified><planet:bozo>true</planet:bozo><planet:activity_threshold>0</planet:activity_threshold><planet:facewidth>65</planet:facewidth><planet:faceheight>85</planet:faceheight><planet:http_status>200</planet:http_status></source></entry>
